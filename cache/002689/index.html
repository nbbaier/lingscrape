In this paper, we argue that the `closest' aspect of this phenomenon is in fact illusory. What may, at first glance, seem like linearly-conditioned
agreement can instead by analyzed as varying orders of the operations Agree and Merge inside the conjunct phrase. 
Thus what may give the impression of agreement with a single conjunct is in fact agreement with a conjunct phrase which has inherited the features of only one of its conjuncts.
Furthermore, the assumption that a given order of operations inside the conjunct phrase
is repeated at later cycles of the derivation makes correct predictions about the possibility for each pattern to occur either pre- or postverbally. Thus, we
arrive at a principled analysis of conjunct agreement, which derives only the attested patterns in Serbo-Croatian and rules out ungrammatical structures without recourse to linear order.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002689/current.pdf?_s=TvcHknPPQbmaVIh8">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/002689<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>to appear in Natural Language and Linguistic Theory</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>closest conjunct agreement, syntax, opacity, serbo-croatian, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/002689/v3.pdf?_s=VPFAaBWicA9TZSJG">v3 [September 2017]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002689/v2.pdf?_s=5xxRFv1NkJl2x5x2">v2 [September 2015]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/002689/v1.pdf?_s=Y9BoQ8tY-fZZ0pPk">v1 [September 2015]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>2201 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/002689?_s=Wt3qJAXUg1HOipL3&amp;_k=-hOb5fQuIFYV_IsL&amp;3">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/002689?_s=Wt3qJAXUg1HOipL3&amp;_k=-hOb5fQuIFYV_IsL&amp;4">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
