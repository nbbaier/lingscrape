In particular, picture noun anaphors seem, under certain conditions, to escape the locality conditions imposed by Condition A of Binding Theory. Previous proposals attribute such apparently exceptional behavior to various sources: the classical Binding Theory appeals to the possible presence of covert agents within NPs; predicate-based theories introduce the possibility of exemption from Condition A; others capitalize on possible homophony with (logophoric) pronouns. While all of these proposals provide valuable insight into some aspect of the puzzle, we show that they all fail to capture the full empirical picture. Based on a detailed examination of their behavior in various syntactic and interpretive conditions, we instead propose that English picture noun anaphors, like any other anaphor, systematically obey Condition A. Their apparent exemption from it in some cases derives from the possible implicitness of some binders, in particular, logophoric pronouns or nominal subjects. Furthermore, the availability of such covert binders is crucially affected by a binding-independent competition principle between weaker and stronger forms. Thus, the apparently irregular behavior of English picture noun anaphors results from the interaction between several factors (syntactic representation of logophoricity, syntactic projection of subjects in nouns, pronominal competition), which is responsible for the illusion that Condition A does not apply systematically. By disentangling these factors, we propose a solution that integrates previous insights without compromising on empirical adequacy or analytical parsimony.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005620/current.pdf?_s=JBBMLmiZKrC7D8Gp">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005620<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>NLLT 2022</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>picture nouns, condition a of binding theory, logophoricity, nominal structure, pronominal competition, semantics, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>previous versions: </td><td><a href="/lingbuzz/005620/v2.pdf?_s=yAF1atOnB3ht9I4H">v2 [August 2021]</a><br/><a href="/lingbuzz/005620/v1.pdf?_s=Q0eAwR3t6d_-BmtW">v1 [December 2020]</a><br/></td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>1184 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005620?_s=CXsqh4Rc1bYHiqbG&amp;_k=RFJXHC0Me6ISoIBz&amp;3">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005620?_s=CXsqh4Rc1bYHiqbG&amp;_k=RFJXHC0Me6ISoIBz&amp;4">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
