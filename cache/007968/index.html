Kiss</a><br/>March 2023</center>&nbsp;<p></p>This paper documents an evolutionary path from parataxis via the correlative construction to finite subordination in the Ugric languages, and also points out parallels in the the Indo-European language family. It claims that parataxis fulfils a particular niche in the grammars of strict SOV languages with non-finite subordination; paratactic complement clauses are used in the case of predicates selecting propositional complements with independent tense and force. In the Ob-Ugric languages, the first – and until recently, the only – finite subordinate clause type to emerge has been the correlative construction. It is argued that the correlative interpretation of this pattern is a recent development; originally, the construction was understood to involve two paratactically juxtaposed coordinate clauses, with an indefinite / indeterminate pronoun in the first one. This structural ambiguity is similar to that attested in the Early Hittite (Hahn 1946; Motter 2023) and Early Latin correlative patterns (Kroll 1910), which suggests a similar development from parataxis to the correlative construction in these languages. In Hungarian, where the correlative pattern has been documented since the 13th century, its further evolution into finite relative clauses and into finite complement clauses is also followed up, and these evolutionary paths are claimed to help to reconstruct undocumented early phases of parallel processes in Indo-European.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007968/current.pdf?_s=iRh8dEotOYh8v8Jv">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007968<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>parataxis, finite subordination, correlative, emergence of relative clause, emergence of complement clause, syntax</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>96 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007968?_s=xUYXrsd408gxdTl6&amp;_k=mwb42iA0kgtd3mFP&amp;2">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007968?_s=xUYXrsd408gxdTl6&amp;_k=mwb42iA0kgtd3mFP&amp;3">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
