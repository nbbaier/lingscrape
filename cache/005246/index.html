I  focus in the  latter  part  of thearticle on  the roleof  one phonotactic constraint in the history of English: *RIME-xxŋ. I argue that weneed to investigate the emergenceof such constraints in the history of languages and I show how this particular constraint, once innovated(which occurs through constraint scattering),can be understoodto have inhibited  the  patterning  of ash-tensing  in certain varieties of American English (and also that it may now have been lost in some varieties). To do  this,  I  adopt  a phonological  model which  combines  aspects  of  rule-based phonology and aspects of constraint-based phonology, and which is firmly rooted in the variation that exists when changes are innovated. Finally, I evaluatethe extent to which thetype of phonotactically-driven process-inhibition that   I   propose here involves   prophylaxis   in phonological  change(I  show  that  it  doesn’t),  and I  consider the interaction  of theseideas with  the proposalthat  all  change  occurs  in language acquisition (‘acquisitionism’).  <table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005246/current.pdf?_s=YUkQFlXcphYlpVrM">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/005246<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Papers in Historical Phonology 4, 83-135</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>diachrony; phonotactics; historical phonology; rime-structure; ash-tensing; prophylaxis; acquisitionism, phonology</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>440 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/005246?_s=5hE7gyguBHw2WM0g&amp;_k=4QenDPhpalimyQGQ&amp;2">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/005246?_s=5hE7gyguBHw2WM0g&amp;_k=4QenDPhpalimyQGQ&amp;3">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
