Four decades of research have failed to resolve the source of this entrenched semantic illusion. Here we adopt the noisy-channel framework for language comprehension to provide a potential explanation. We hypothesize that depth-charge sentences result from inferences whereby comprehenders derive the interpretation by weighing the plausibility of possible readings of the depth-charge sentences against the likelihood of plausible sentences being produced with errors. In four experiments, we find that (1) the more plausible the intended meaning of the depth-charge sentence is, the more likely the sentence is to be misinterpreted; and (2) the higher the likelihood of our hypothesized noise operations, the more likely depth-charge sentences are to be misinterpreted. These results suggest that misinterpretation is affected by both world knowledge and the distance between the depth-charge sentence and a plausible alternative, which is consistent with the noisy-channel framework.<table cellspacing="15" valign="top"><tr><td>Format: </td><td>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007007/current.pdf?_s=Q-aR2wLUGCZniBUb">pdf</a> ]</td></tr><tr><td>Reference: </td><td>lingbuzz/007007<br/><font size="-1"> (please use that when you cite this article)</font></td></tr><tr><td>Published in: </td><td>Cognition</td></tr><tr><td>keywords: </td><td>depth-charge, noisy-channel, semantic illusion, semantics</td></tr><tr><td>Downloaded:</td><td>353 times</td></tr></table><table cellspacing="15"><tr><p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>[ <a href="/lingbuzz/007007?_s=4MamWgM1iEeoffcp&amp;_k=_sgHTin6O9bX1Mzw&amp;4">edit this article</a> | <a href="/lingbuzz/007007?_s=4MamWgM1iEeoffcp&amp;_k=_sgHTin6O9bX1Mzw&amp;5">back to article list</a> ]</tr></table><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/function onLoad(){};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
