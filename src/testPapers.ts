    authors: ["Michal Starke"],

    published_in: "",
    keywords_raw: "syntax, elegance",
    keywords: ["syntax", "elegance"],
    abstract:
      "This papers argues that there is no such thing as 'specifier' (as distinct from 'head'). Put differently, all merges are first merges and there is no such thing as 'second merge' (with different properties from first merge). What we (mis)took for specifiers are in fact heads, in the sense that they project the label of the merger. As a result, all syntactic relations reduce to head-complement relations. It is argued that this simplification makes the theory both more elegant and more integrated. The independently needed theory of labelling now does much more work, and extraneous assumptions such as 'checking domains and mechanisms' are unnecessary.",

    title: "The Typology of Structural Deficiency",

    date: "October 1994",
    published_in: "",
    keywords_raw: "principles and parameters, clitics, syntax, pronouns",
    keywords: ["principles and parameters", "clitics", "syntax", "pronouns"],
    abstract:
      "We argue that there is an intermediate class of pronouns, less deficient than clitics but more deficient than strong pronouns. These intermediate pronouns, 'weak pronouns', are XPs but cannot be modified, coordinated, etc. on a par with clitics. In the first part of the article we survey the evidence showing the need for a tripartition, and in the second part we offer a theory of the tripartition in which 'deficiency' is a progressive peeling away of structural layers, from the top of the representation. Weak pronouns are thus noun phrases with the top layer peeled off, and clitics are still more deprived. It is shown that this approach correctly handles the cross-modular facts about clitics, and elegantly integrates clitics (and weak pronouns) with the rest of our knowledge about phrase-structure.",

    abstract:
      "In this paper we argue that, under current conceptions of the architecture of the grammar, apparent wh-dependencies can, in principle, arise from either a movement or a base generation strategy, where AGREE establishes the syntactic connection in the latter case. The crucial diagnostics are not locality effects, but rather identity effects. We implement the base generation analysis using a minimal set of semantically interpretable features, together with a maximally simple universal syntax/semantics correspondence. We show that parametric variation arises because of the different way the features are bundled on functional heads. We further argue that it is the bundling of two features on a single lexical item, together with the correspondence that requires them to be interpreted apart, that is responsible for the displacement property of human languages.",

      "This dissertation argues that phenomena like adverb placement, short verb movement and verb second, which form core cases in support of contemporary notions of CP-fields and IP-fields in the clause (fseq), are better handled ways which do not resort to the notion of arbitrary selectional sequences of (functional) syntactic heads. The real issue is the use of selection/checking to derive clausal hierarchies, and the proposal is that we should need neither, and that the distribution of (functional) categories should follow exclusively from independently motivated interface conditions. If so, there is no need to encode selection/checking as syntactic primitives.",
